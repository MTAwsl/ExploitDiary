Hi, I am an inconspicuous person who is enthusiastic about different areas in computer.&#x20;

Though still trying to get a peaceful life in rough days, I hope I will learn and contribute with my passion.

### üí° I am confident with

* **Debugging**: I love finding and fixing bugs on all kinds of computers.&#x20;
* **Learning**: I can learn things very quick by doing projects around that topic.
* **Problem-Solving**: I am proud of my problem-solving skills as a reverse engineer, and I can use that skill in many areas such as programming.

### **‚ö° Things I know about**

* **Languages**:&#x20;
  * C/C++, Python, Java, Swift, Rust, Assembly languages (with docs)
  * Bash, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL
  * and all kinds of programming languages that have a detailed documentation.
* **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Node.js, Flask, Django
* **Tools**: Git, Docker, VS Code, Burpsuite, Ghidra, GDB

~~(These are things I used but I am not confident. Need to read docs when I'm using them)~~

I personally don't like to categories them as _tech stack_, since I am just using them as tools but not what I depends on.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Dotfiles**

* **LF**: Support image preview in terminal
* **NeoVim**: LunarVim theme with debuggers
